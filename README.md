# School_District_Analysis
Analysis of school district data using Jupyter notebooks.
This is an analysis of public and charter school district data. The data contains information about school size, type, budgets, and test scores. First, I cleaned the data by removing duplicate entries and standardizing the data types. Then, I used descriptive statistics about the data frame to understand the range of test scores across schools. By using slicing functions I was able to get a more granular view of the data by school, school type, grade, and so on. Using the methods and tools I have used here, one could pursue more specific questions about how test results are influenced differently by charter schools and public schools.
